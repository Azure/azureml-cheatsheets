# Additional resources

## Prerequisites

- To use the CLI, you must have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.
- To use the CLI commands in this document from your **local environment**, you need the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?preserve-view=true&view=azure-cli-latest).

> [!TIP]
> If you use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com//features/cloud-shell/), the CLI is accessed through the browser and lives in the cloud. You can try it to run through all the training and scoring tutorials in this documentation!
