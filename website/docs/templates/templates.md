## Framework templates

- None

## Contributing (a template)

Copy the base template, adapting it for your scenario and following all guidelines below. Make a PR here to add it to the appropriate list.

### Principle

Less but better.

### Spirit

The spirit of AML templates includes:

- frequent and comprehensive testing
- clear separation of cloud code (job definition) and user code
- users can get up and running in 10 minutes with their own data/code

### General rules

- minimal prose
- minimalist code
- workflows re-run without failing at least daily

### Enforced naming

- repo should be published to https://github.com/Azure
- repo should be named `azureml-template-*`, using hyphens to separate words

### Additional guidance

It is best to follow the guidance from the [example repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) where applicable.
